This app simulates Population PK and PD based on a 2-compartment Population PK model with extravascular administration and linear elimination connected to an indirect response PD model where the drug inhibits the production of response.
We can visualize the effect of dose, dosing interval, and number of doses onthe PK and PD and can change the number if subjects included in the simulation
The app is based on python code and visualization using dash in python
